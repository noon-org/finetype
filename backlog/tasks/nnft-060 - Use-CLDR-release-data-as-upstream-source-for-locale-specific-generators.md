## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Integrate Unicode CLDR (Common Locale Data Repository) data as the authoritative source for all locale-specific training data generation.

CLDR v48.1 (Jan 2026) provides:
- **Date/time patterns** per locale (short/medium/long/full)
- **Number formatting** (decimal separator, grouping, percent, currency)
- **Currency info** (symbols, names, placement per locale)
- **Month/day names** (abbreviated, wide, narrow per locale)
- **Measurement units** and their locale-specific formatting
- **Language/country/timezone names** per locale

Rather than hardcoding locale patterns in individual generators, this task establishes CLDR XML/JSON data as the single source of truth. Generators for dates, numbers, currencies, addresses, and other locale-dependent types would read from CLDR data at training time.

This is the foundational data layer that tasks like locale phone numbers, locale dates, and locale addresses would build on.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CLDR data (XML or JSON) downloaded and accessible for training data generation
- [ ] #2 Parser extracts date/time patterns, number formats, and month/day names per locale
- [ ] #3 At least 10 locales fully parsed and validated
- [ ] #4 Generators can import CLDR data instead of hardcoded patterns
