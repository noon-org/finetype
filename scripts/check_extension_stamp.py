"""Gate the version stamp a built DuckDB extension carries in its metadata trailer.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    The stamp is the only version a `.duckdb_extension` carries in a form a
    machine can read BEFORE loading it. DuckDB surfaces it as
    `duckdb_extensions().extension_version`; a packager reads it straight out of
    the file's last 512 bytes. Anyone who has to tell two builds apart reads
    that field and nothing else.

    Every extension this project published between 2026-06-28, when
    configure/extension_version.txt was committed, and the commit that removed
    it carries `0.6.23`, whatever tag it was built from -- and the file was
    still there when this was written. The cause is that one committed file.
    The build contract

    writes the version through this rule, in
    extension-ci-tools/makefiles/c_api_extensions/base.Makefile:

        configure/extension_version.txt:
        	@ $(VERSION_COMMAND)

    A file target with no prerequisites is never remade once it exists, so a
    tree that ARRIVES with the file already in it never runs VERSION_COMMAND at
    all. The file was tracked in git, so a checkout arrived with it, so the
    autodetection did not run in CI, and the committed literal was stamped onto
    each artefact built after it was committed. Measured on the local build of
    2026-06-04: trailer offset 128 reads `0.6.23` while the tree was at 0.6.58.


    The fix is to stop tracking the file and let the build write it. That fix
    is invisible -- a file that regenerates silently is the same shape of trust
    that produced the defect -- so this gate reads the ARTEFACT'S BYTES and
    refuses a release whose stamp disagrees with the tag it was built from.

WHAT EACH MODE DECIDES, and each is a different defect with a different fix,
which is why each has its own exit code rather than a shared 1:

    --artifact FILE... --tag TAG    (exit 1, exit 3)
        The trailer version of each named artefact equals TAG. Read off the
        file's bytes, never from configure/extension_version.txt: the file is
        what the build wrote, the bytes are what the user receives, and the
        whole defect above is the two disagreeing. A leading `v` is stripped
        from both sides and nothing else is normalised -- see NORMALISATION.

    --artifact FILE... --expect-commit SHA    (exit 1, exit 3)
        The same question asked of a build from an UNTAGGED ref, where the
        stamp must be that commit's abbreviated sha. This is the one that runs
        on a pull request, so the autodetection is observed on every build
        rather than a handful of times a year -- and the committed literal
        fails it, because `0.6.23` abbreviates no commit.

    --artifact FILE --load          (exit 7)
        The version the extension reports AT RUN TIME and the version in its
        trailer, read off ONE artefact in ONE DuckDB session. `ft_version()`
        comes from CARGO_PKG_VERSION compiled into the cdylib;
        `duckdb_extensions().extension_version` is DuckDB's own reading of the
        trailer. Two independent sources, one file, one LOAD.

        THE LOAD IS WHAT ESTABLISHES IDENTITY, and the byte reading above
        cannot: any valid shared library stamped by extension-ci-tools'
        append_extension_metadata script passes a trailer read. Most of the
        refusing is DuckDB's own -- it dlsyms an init symbol derived from the
        FILE NAME, so a re-stamped stranger renamed finetype.duckdb_extension
        does not load at all. The `ft_version()` name check in this file is the
        backstop for what DuckDB would accept, a library that does export that
        symbol, and the self-test reaches it by substituting the session's
        reading because no file on disk produces it. This mode also requires
        DuckDB to report the extension as loaded and NOT installed -- an
        installed community build could otherwise answer for the file on disk.

        The artefact must be one this machine can load, and it is refused BY
        NAME when it is not: see require_native.


    --untracked-version-file        (exit 4, exit 5)
        Nothing under configure/ is tracked in git, and
        configure/extension_version.txt is ignored. Both halves, because they
        fail differently: a tracked file disables the rule that writes it, and
        an un-ignored one comes back on the next `git add`.

    --release-wiring                (exit 8)
        This gate is invoked at each point a wrong stamp can escape, unguarded,
        and before the bytes are published. Every mode above refuses something;
        NOTHING MAKES THEM RUN except the two release workflows, and those are
        YAML that no check in this repository read. One `continue-on-error:
        true` turns the refusal into a warning and leaves this file's own
        --self-test green. Read as structure -- jobs, guards, steps, order --
        through the reader in .github/scripts/gate-self-tests.py, so there is
        one parser of a workflow in this repository rather than two that drift.

    --regenerates-version-file      (exit 6)

        The Makefile forces the version file to be regenerated even when one is
        already on disk. Untracking the file fixes CI, where every checkout is
        fresh; it does not fix a developer's tree, where a file written by the
        previous build persists and upstream's rule still has no prerequisites.
        Asked of make itself with `make -n`, so what is observed is make's
        rebuild decision rather than a string in the Makefile.

NORMALISATION
    A single leading `v` is stripped from both sides of every version
    comparison, and nothing else is. A git tag carries one and a DuckDB
    extension version stamp does not have to; upstream's autodetection writes
    `git tag --points-at HEAD` verbatim, so a tagged build stamps `v0.6.58`
    while the local `make build-extension` path stamps Cargo.toml's `0.6.58`.
    Both are the same release and both must pass. The consumer that decides
    this is brightfield's bundle check, which strips a leading `v` from both
    sides and compares the rest exactly; a tolerant comparison beyond that
    would let `0.6.23` under `v0.6.58` through, which is the entire defect.

UNTAGGED BUILDS
    Upstream's autodetection falls back to `git --no-pager log -1 --format=%h`
    -- a short commit sha -- when no tag points at HEAD. That fallback is kept
    unchanged: a pull-request build stamps its sha, which is a true statement
    about what was built and is what the community CI does for every other
    extension. `--tag` is never passed on an untagged build, because the only
    workflow that passes it triggers on `tags: ['v*']`. A tagged build cannot
    pass with a fallback stamp: a short sha does not equal the tag, so the
    comparison refuses and says which of the two it is looking at.
