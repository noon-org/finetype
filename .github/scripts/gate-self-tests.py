"""Route each gate's self-test to the diffs that change that gate, and prove the routing.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    A gate earns its exit code from a self-test: a harness that mutates the gate,
    or the tree the gate reads, and requires the gate to redden. Fourteen of them
    ship here. Every one ran on every pull request, whether or not the diff went
    anywhere near the gate it covers -- so the cheapest change in the repository
    paid for the most expensive proof, and the rule "a changed gate re-proves
    itself" was held by a reviewer remembering it rather than by anything that
    checks.

    Two things have to be true at once and only one of them is obvious:

      the self-test RUNS when its gate changes  -- otherwise the proof is
          optional, which is the same as absent;
      the self-test DOES NOT RUN when it does not  -- otherwise it is a tax, and
          a tax gets trimmed by whoever is next in a hurry.

    An always-on step satisfies the first and fails the second. A step someone
    remembers to add satisfies neither for long.

WHAT THIS DOES
    `plan`  reads `.github/gate-self-tests.tsv`, diffs the pull request against
            its base, and emits one boolean per gate into `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`. Each
            self-test step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is guarded by its own
            boolean, so the workflow runs exactly the proofs the diff invalidated.

    `audit` is the half that keeps `plan` honest, and it runs unconditionally
            because it is the cheap one. It reddens when the manifest, the tree
            and the workflow stop agreeing -- a gate nothing routes, a guard
            written `== 'false'` so the proof runs only when the gate did not
            change, a condition on the step that does the routing.

            THE WORST SHAPE IS THE LAST ONE, and it is why this paragraph does
            not lead with the guards. Skip the routing step and every output in
            that job is empty, so every proof skips AND the audit meant to refuse
            the tree never runs -- in a job that reports green and complete. A
            missing guard costs one proof; a skipped planner costs the proofs and
            the check on them together.

            IT IS A LIST OF REFUSED SHAPES, NOT A PROOF OF EXHAUSTION. Every shape
            it covers has a named case in `--self-test` and the case list is the
            enumeration -- read it rather than trusting a count in prose. Six
            shapes have been added by people reading this file rather than running
            it, the last two after the audit was already refusing four, so the
            honest prior is that more exist. When you find the seventh, add the
            rule and its case; do not tighten this sentence.

FAIL-SAFE DIRECTION
    Every uncertainty routes MORE work, never less. No base commit, an
    unfetchable base, a diff that will not run, a change to the manifest, to this
    file, or to the workflow -- each selects every gate and says so in the log.
    A router that cannot tell what changed must never answer "nothing".

USAGE
    .github/scripts/gate-self-tests.py plan --base <sha>   # emit the booleans
    .github/scripts/gate-self-tests.py audit               # manifest vs tree vs workflow
    .github/scripts/gate-self-tests.py --self-test         # prove all of the above

EXIT CODES
    0  clean
    1  findings -- the audit disagrees with the tree, or a self-test case did not
       redden
    2  the tool could not run correctly: a malformed manifest, an unreadable
       workflow, no routing step. Always a hard failure, never a quiet pass.

    depending on it were SKIPPED, and a required status check that is skipped
    SATISFIES branch protection -- the pull request reported UNSTABLE, which is
    mergeable, not BLOCKED. Two of this repository's five required contexts were
    among them. Routing inside the job removes the dependency, so a required
    check can no longer be satisfied by not running.
